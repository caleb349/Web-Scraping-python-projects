<p class="story">Eleven (11) of the Warrior student-athletes and head coach Carrie Lohr took time to read to students between kindergarten and fifth grade.  During the three hours they spent at the school, WSU divided into groups and rotated every 20 minutes, reading in 18 different classrooms.

Reading to the students at Hamilton Elementary was a wonderful experience," commented freshman Alexis Miller (Howell, Mich.).  "It was amazing to help educate younger students on the importance of hard work and determination.  I had so much fun with the kids and I was happy to give back to the community."
