# Web-Scraping-python-projects

Task:  To complete this assignment, you should write a Python program that scrapes information from the HTML DOM of web pages using BeautifulSoup.

You do NOT need a welcome message or user input for this exercise; this script is performing a task for you, not asking a user to play a game or for input to complete a task 
Scrape five (5) different websites (of your choosing)
Grab 3 pieces of information from each site:
This needs to be from inside an HTML tag (not the HTML tag and content, but just the content inside the tag)
Each piece of information should come from different HTML tags (e.g., <a>, <li>, <p>, <h1>, etc)
Use BeautifulSoup to retrieve the data
Save your data in text files (*.txt) :
One file for each website's data (5 files in total)
Print out the URL of the site you scraped at the beginning of your text file, followed by 3 line breaks
Print out the information underneath the line breaks in the text file
Name the files accordingly (i.e., dataFromGoodreads.txt)
